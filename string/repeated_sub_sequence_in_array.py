'''
The idea is very simple. 
If we discard all non-repeating elements from the string (having frequency of 1) 
and the resulting string is non-Palindrome, 
then the string contains a repeated subsequence. 
If the resulting string is a palindrome and donâ€™t have any character with frequency 3 or more,
 the string cannot have repeated subsequence.
